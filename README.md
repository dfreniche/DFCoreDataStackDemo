#DFCoreDataStack Demo

Simple demo of an again _simple Core Data Stack_ file used to create NSManagedObject context, etc.

`DFCoreDataStack.*`is the interesting part

Inspired by this blog post: [http://commandshift.co.uk/blog/2013/09/07/the-core-data-stack/](), based on an iOSDevUK session with Markus Zarra I also attend.

Used at the MWC'14 WIPJam [Core Data Workshop](http://wipjammwc14.sched.org/event/c80b40922c7abb24aa768388f60fa5b6)
